This is a project that will allow a user to view BeyBlade toys and their components and organize and create new
combinations of BeyBlade toys.

Currently, the user can only read the files.  Organization and creation will functionality will be added in the future.

========================================================================================================================

Required modules:

openpyxl
sys
time

========================================================================================================================

The user will:

    1) Be able to access a list of stock BeyBlades and the three components of which they are made.  These will be read from an external database (xslx) file.


========================================================================================================================

Features addressed per Project Requirements:


#COMPLETED (menu)
# Implement a “master loop” console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform
# actions, including choosing to exit the program.

#COMPLETED (via openpyxl reading workbooks and contained worksheets)
# Read data from an external file, such as text, JSON, CSV, etc and use that data in your application

#COMPLETED (defined menu, each worksheet of the workbook, and function that verifies input and excepts error.)
# Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.

**Possible Other (stylized outro (exit of program) to align with BeyBlade real play... when battling BeyBlades IRL, the battle begins with each player saying. "3, 2, 1... Let it rip!"

# improve db output style from menu choices

# edit user dbs

# create new user db worksheets in beyblade_db.xlsx
